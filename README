The goal is to write the gui in Tkx to have options for major and minor keys and flat or sharp notes returned. 
The program needs a combo added so the user can pick whether they want sharp or flat notes returned; 
and whether the key they want is major or minor.
As you can see there is also lots of extraneous commented out code that could be removed.
The test programs were quick tests to see if something worked or not.
