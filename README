The goal is to write the gui in Tkx to have options for major and minor keys and flat or sharp notes returned. 
The program needs a checkbox added so the user can pick whether they want sharp or flat notes (line 141).
As you can see there is also lots of extraneous commented out code that could be removed.
The test programs were quick tests to see if something worked or not.
